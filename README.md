##### Mockup - 
Planned to have five graphs as [shown in mockup](/assets/pre-production/mock-up-project-2.pdf)

#### Note on Chrome Bug
There is a bug in Google Chrome affecting the dataTable. It causes the first whiskey
to be incorrectly place at the top of the list. The second whiskey is the one that
actually should take the top position.
This issue is inexistent on Mozilla.

##### Notes on mockup

[Inspiration 1](https://blog.quiet.ly/community/how-to-create-a-writing-portfolio-for-freelancers/)

Have a look at the mockup [HERE](/pre-production-information/project-1.pdf)

### Features
As per the projects brief:</br>
✓ Create a website of around 4-5 pages</br>
✓ Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this).</br>
✓ Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5.</br>
✓ Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. 
✓ We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.</br>
✓ The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
</br>


### Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome
- Bootstrap 3.3.7
</br>

### Testing

Manual testing included frequent use of the Developer Tools to adjust style to different screens.</br>
Manual clicking and confirmation that the links work as expected.</br>

### Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
